### Description

Formats any valid Lua 5.3 code.

Lines with code are wrapped to fit inside given margins.

Files with invalid Lua syntax may lose the content after the syntax
error! If this is a problem - verify the correctness of the file
before running reformatter. For example via `$ luac -p <lua_file>`.

Installation deploys three command-line scripts:

  * `lua.reformat`
  * `lua.get_ast`
  * `lua.get_formatter_ast`

Last two for people who love tinkering.

### Usage

#### From command-line

`lua.reformat [<lua_file>]`

#### From Lua interpreter

Suppose you have a string with Lua code and wish to get another string
with formatted code.

```Lua
do
  local lua_code_str = 'do return end' -- < fill it

  require('lcf.workshop.base')
  local get_ast = request('!.lua.code.get_ast')
  local get_formatted_code = request('!.lua.code.ast_as_code')

  return get_formatted_code(get_ast(lua_code_str))
end
```

##### Passing formatting parameters

You may override default parameters by passing a table with new values
of changed parameters:

```lua
get_formatted_code(
  get_ast(lua_code_str),
  {
    indent_chunk = '  ',
    right_margin = 96,
    max_text_width = math.huge,
    keep_unparsed_tail = true,
    keep_comments = true,
  }
)
```

| Parameter            | Default | Description                                            | Notes |
| ---                  | :---:   | ---                                                    | --- |
| `indent_chunk`       | ` ` ` ` | String used for building one indent.                   | You may try value `\|..` to see it's effect. |
| `right_margin`       | 96      | Maximum line length with indent.                       | Setting it makes sense for printing. |
| `max_text_width`     | +inf    | Maximum line length without indent.                    | Setting it makes sense for viewing in editor. |
| `keep_unparsed_tail` | true    | Keep text after point where we failed to parse source. | Syntactically incorrect code may still lose parts even with this flag. For example `f() = a` is formatted as `f()`. (It's parsed as assignment but formatted as function call.) |
| `keep_comments`      | true    | Keep comments.                                         | Comment text is not changed so comments may last beyond right margin. |

##### Comments handling

Comments are raised to statements level.

So text
  ```lua
  function(a, --parameter "a"
    b) --parameter "b"
  end
  ```
is formatted as
  ```lua
  --parameter "a"
  function(a, b)
    --parameter "b"
  end
  ```
This is done to keep formatting routines simple.

### Changing formatting logic

First, general workflow of this formatter:

1. Load `.lua` file as string.
2. Parse that string to tree in table.
3. Change nodes of that tree to make it easier to handle in formatting
  routines.
4. Run formatting routines for all nodes in tree. Formatting routines
  output to virtual printer.
5. Write contents of virtual printer to file.

We are at point `4`. Start tinkering from something simple but usable
as "repeat" block handling:
`workshop/formats/lua/formatter/handlers/statements/blocks/repeat_block.lua`

### Contributors

* Several people were asking to keep comments. This was done and
  `--keep-comments` option was added.
* `Peter Melnichenko â™°` shown me how to write cross-platform
  `.rockspec` file.
* `Oliver Jan Krylow` added cautions in `readme.md` that file with
  invalid syntax loses tail. I've mentioned `$ luac -p` workaround
  and added `--keep-unparsed-tail` option to detect and prevent
  this.
* `keneanung` adoped formatter to Lua 5.1 syntax and pushed branch
  `5.1-syntax_5.1`. Main audience of this is LuaJIT users.

### Further development

I feel this project is done. Original goal to reformat ugly code from
World of Warcraft addons accomplished.

* I'm planning to keep it compatible with current PuC-Lua version.
* Maybe I'll add more documentation about inner mechanics.
* Maybe I'll add more advanced formatting like empty lines before
  long `for` blocks.
